          If you are currently a writer and work as a freelancer, we offer you
          the opportunity to expand your knowledge and potential by building
          your brand as an Author. We give full credit to our Authors and
          support and promote empowerment of women through our network. With
          risk comes reward, but we will handle the stressful side of the
          business. We will help you enjoy the benefits of earning income over
          time. Why would you limit yourself and the value of your work by
          accepting ghostwriting contracts to pay a small one-time fee?
          Freelancer has the word free in it because you are essentially selling
          your work at a minimal price compared to the value it can possess.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-1 mb-5 pe-xxl-8">
          We look forward to helping you through the publishing process. Our
          knowledge will help you publish your first, second, or subsequent
          books. We sign every Author to a one-book contract to start to allow
          Authors flexibility in their individual careers.Â
