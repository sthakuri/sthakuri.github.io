My name is Allison Moore. I am a 21-year-old American/Balinese business student, freelance writer, and artist. I grew up in California, but have spent the second half of my life living in Bali.

I have always loved writing and reading – so obsessed I was with my books as a child that I would read them over and over. I have filled notebooks and laptops alike with stories, and eventually my passion led to writing articles, short stories, and finally full books

There is no shortage of topics I want to explore through words, but I am most interested in those related to my self-expression of personality & culture. I cannot wait to lead you through an adventure in my corner of the world”!
