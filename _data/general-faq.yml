- question:
    I’m an Author looking to submit work for your next publication?!
  answer:
    'Please submit your 100 word sample to management@izimarkpublishing.com 
    <br/>
    We ask for the first 100 words to your book for a few different reasons. The first and most important is due to the marketability of your book. We want to make sure your penman ship is marketable so that we do not give false hope and lead writers to fake potential as Authors. The second reason is because the sample is the most important part in the online sales. If we walk through the average consumers patterns fo buying books online, the first thing that is seen is the cover. The next thing that the buyer sees will be the sample we asked for originally. It is important that the sample has a "call to action" which is essentially a reason for the buyer to buy the book.'
