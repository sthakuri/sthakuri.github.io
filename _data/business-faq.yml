- question:
    How can your business help me as a writer?
  answer:
    'First of all as mentioned earlier, we allow free services which minimizes your risks from self publishing cost deficits. We also provide a stepping stone opportunity for University and College graduates who may not have the opportunity to find their job of choice. This may be due to lack of experience in the given field or lack of resources. We help mitigate that problem because for the millionth time “WE ARE FREE”. 
    <br/>
    The stepping stone that is being referred to is the opportunity we provide to go above and beyond competitors in your potential future job interviews. As a published Author, you have a “step up” from your future interviewee competitors. Any successful Author can create a full time career from their writing; especially with an all inclusive platform such as ours. To summarize, this is why we say “the only failure is not trying”. 
    <br/>
    Not all publishing houses are the same, ours is based on prioritizing our Authors and not our pockets.  To top it off, we have educated many writers on the topic of ghostwriter vs. Author.'
- question:
    How We See It & How We Do It?
  answer:
    'How We See it: Ghostwriter (Freelancer)= Paid one time fee (around 50$), No credit for the work (hence use of the word ghost).
    <br/>
    How We Do it: Author (Passive Income)= Paid bi-weekly based on sales (advance optional), Full credit for work (career opportunity) 
    <br/>
    Ghostwriting is like going to medical school for 8 years then working at McDonald’s. Why would you go to medical school to realize someone else dreams? Ghostwriters do not realize they are ghostwriters until they understand the difference between and Author and freelancer. Freelancer just means you receive a one time payment for small jobs. There is a reason that the word free is in the sentence. 
    <br/>
    In summary, we allow you to see the difference between making one book for money forever (passive income as an Author) and making books forever for money (ghostwriting - freelance jobs).'
